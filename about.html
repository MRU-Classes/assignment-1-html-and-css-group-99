  Hello! I’m Rizwan Mirza, currently pursuing a Bachelor’s in Computer Information Systems at Mount Royal University. Over the past three years, I’ve honed my skills in Java, Python, and web development, building everything from interactive web pages to data-driven applications. Beyond coding, I’m passionate about inspiring the next generation of technologists—I’ve led after-school workshops where I break down complex concepts into fun, hands-on activities that keep young learners engaged and excited about problem solving.

Whether it’s guiding students through their first HTML page or helping them visualize algorithms with simple games, my goal is to make programming accessible, interactive, and enjoyable for kids of all ages. I look forward to helping young minds discover the joy of code!

  Teaching kids to code is about much more than simply writing lines of syntax—it cultivates a mindset of logical thinking, creativity, and resilience that serves them across all areas of life. When children learn to program, they develop computational thinking, breaking down complex challenges into manageable steps and learning to spot patterns. These analytical skills translate directly into stronger problem-solving abilities in mathematics, science, and everyday situations.

Coding also offers a creative outlet: by building their own games, animations, or interactive stories, kids see immediate, tangible results of their imagination. This hands-on approach to creativity boosts confidence as they learn that mistakes are simply part of the design process—debugging becomes an empowering lesson in perseverance rather than a source of frustration.

In an increasingly digital world, early exposure to programming lays the foundation for digital literacy. Understanding how software works behind the scenes helps children become more informed consumers of technology and better collaborators with engineers and designers in future projects. As automation and artificial intelligence reshape the job market, coding proficiency gives students a head start in careers that value technical fluency and innovative thinking.

Finally, coding classes foster collaboration and communication, since many projects are team-based and encourage peer feedback. By learning to articulate their ideas clearly and work together on shared objectives, kids gain social and leadership skills that will benefit them far beyond the computer screen. Encouraging children to code empowers them to become creators—rather than just users—of the technology that surrounds us.
